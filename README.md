# Running Predictor

This project is an app that allows me to predict my race times based on my personal data as stored in Strava.

The end result is a [Shiny app](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/running_predictor/app.R) that predicts my race pace based on race length and training distance. 

[running_predictor.md](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/running_predictor.md) explains the project's results.

[running_project_notebook.md](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/running_project_notebook.md) contains my project notes where I played around with models and visualizations to see which variables should be incorporated into the final tool.

[activities.csv](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/activities.csv) contains the raw data imported from Strava.
