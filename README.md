# Running Predictor

This project is a work in progress. I am attempting to create a tool that will predict race times based on my personal running data as stored in Strava.

[running_predictor.md](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/running_predictor.md) explains the project's results (so far).

[running_project_notebook.md](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/running_project_notebook.md) contains my project notes where I play around with models and visualization to see which variables should be incorporated into the final tool.

[activities.csv](https://github.com/jamesphare/running_predictor/blob/master/activities.csv) contains the raw data imported from Strava.
